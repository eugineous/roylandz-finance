## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to explore the landing page, interactive budgeting demo, and detailed sections outlining the product vision.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main landing page markup with sections for features, target audiences, brand values, AI roadmap, security, and founder story.
- `styles.css` – custom styling inspired by the Roylandz palette and typography guidance.
- `script.js` – lightweight enhancements powering the instant budgeting calculator and dynamic footer year.

No build tools are required; the experience runs entirely in the browser.
